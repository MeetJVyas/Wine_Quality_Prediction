# Wine Quality Prediction Using SVM
In this project I am using Support Vector Machine Classifier to classify and predict Quality of Wine

Project Description:
In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like quality category, citric acid quantity, chlorides density etc and using it to predict red wine quality.
However, first pre-processing the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality
